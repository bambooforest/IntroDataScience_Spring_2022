# Getting started

To get started with this course, you will need to [install](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_(computer_programs)) several software packages and get to know how to use them. Follow all the steps that you need below, before moving on to [chapter 2](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/2_writing_scientific_reports).


## GitHub

Create a [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) account:

* https://github.com

Add your university email and your GitHub path / username to the [repositories tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1di-H7lsmdkT1RJlsXERkIcBSE4Y6XKIwPdulyaZ13DM/edit#gid=788106030&range=A1). For example, see how I added mine in the spreadsheet, which can be rendered like this in [Rmarkdown tables](https://dereksonderegger.github.io/570L/15-rmarkdown-tricks.html):

| Unine email address | GitHub username | Your data science class repository URL |
|:------|:-----|:---------|
| steven.moran@unine.ch | bambooforest | https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/ |

If you cannot access the schedule in google docs, send me an email. I have made it by invitation only so that only course participants have access to it.

Start to understand what [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) is and how to use GitHub. Here are some tutorials (but there are many more on the web):

* https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQLK8Ib_SKk
* https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/github-and-rstudio/
* https://happygitwithr.com/index.html
* https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/
* https://lab.github.com

You do not need to go through all of them! You need a basic understanding of how to use your GitHub, i.e., how to access it, how to add, edit, and remove files from it (as discussed below). There are advanced methods that we can discuss in class, but that are not required to do the work in this class, e.g.,

https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

That being said, putting a bit of extra effort into understand methods like [forking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) will not only help you better understand common practices in data science and software engineering, but also allow you to access and collaborate with [over 200 million repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub):

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow

There are a number of good [GUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) for working with GitHub. For example:

* https://gitup.co
* https://desktop.github.com/
* https://acodez.in/git-gui-clients/

In your GitHub account, e.g. mine is [https://github.com/bambooforest](https://github.com/bambooforest), create a repository for your data practicals. It is up to you if you choose to have the repository public or private. If it is private, you will have to add in the settings the GitHub username of anyone and everyone that you want to give access to it. If you go private, you will have to give me access so that I can grade the data practicals. If you go public, think about which [software license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license) is to be associated with your repository. GitHub gives you a list to choose from, including [creative commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). Choose wisely!

Since one of the [two hardest things in Computer Science (and Data Science)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html) is "naming things", you may either spend some time coming up with a repository name that you like (and ideally that makes sense) or you can simply call it IntroDataScience. You can always change it later! (Caveat: but then you must update the URL in the [repositories tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1di-H7lsmdkT1RJlsXERkIcBSE4Y6XKIwPdulyaZ13DM/edit#gid=788106030&range=A1) and to tell anyone else you may have shared the URL with -- another reason why naming things is hard: changing names, whether variables in code, URLs, physical addresses, etc., **causes more work**!).

In your data practicals repository for this course, start by creating a [README markdown file](README.md) file -- like the one that you're currently reading -- but instead add some text about what your repository is for.

Why is a "README" file important? [LMGTFY](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/lmgtfy/):

* [https://www.google.com/search?&q=what+is+a+read+me+file](https://www.google.com/search?&q=what+is+a+read+me+file)

Pro-tip: when you initially create a [GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo), if you check the appropriate settings, an empty `README.md` file is created for you. Go ahead and [edit](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files) it.


## RStudio

Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), unless you are already an R Pro and prefer some other [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), or [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that allows you to [create R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html) reports that will be stored in your GitHub repository.


## R

This course assumes you are familiar with the basics of the [R programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language). If you are not, please familiarize yourself with the basics. There are many tutorials out there! Here is a free one from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com):

* https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/free-introduction-to-r


## Text editor

You will need a good [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) to access and edit [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text). Please try to understand the difference between plain text and so-called [rich text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formatted_text). For example, a good text editor is not [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word) -- MS Word is a good rich text editor. Depending on your computer's [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), you might consider for example:

* [BBEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBEdit): https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/ ([macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)) 
* [Notepad++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B): https://notepad-plus-plus.org ([Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows))

If you are using some form of [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) you probably already know what you're doing.

Note: there are many other plain text editor software programs ou there. [LMGTFY](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/lmgtfy/):
