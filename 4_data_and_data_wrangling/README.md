## In general

According to the [dictionary
app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_(software)) on my
computer, style can be defined in various ways, including:

-   ‚Äúa manner of doing something‚Äù
-   ‚Äúa way of using language‚Äù
-   ‚Äúa way of behaving or approaching a situation that is characteristic
    of or favored by a particular person‚Äù
-   ‚Äúelegance and sophistication‚Äù

Most people recognize style when they see it. Whether it is someone‚Äôs
manner or behavior, the way they speak or write, how they dress, how
they create art, etc.

When writing, scientific papers or other things, a [style guide (or
manual of style)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) is often
provided so that different writers (say for example submitting to the
same journal or magazine or news outlet) follow a set of standards for
the writing, formatting, or design of the output being produced. They
typically follow a so-called style-sheet. The idea is that an
established standard makes it easier to create a consistent flow, which
is intended to improve readability, and thus, communication. Consider
for example, if within a scientific paper, every table presented had a
completely different look. Consider the follow example of ugly papers
from [this
website](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/figure-titles-captions.html):

We will talk more about style in data visualizations in future lectures.

## Style in (R) code

Style is also an important factor when writing computer code. All major
software companies have [programming style
guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style). Why? Because a
style guide standard that software engineers follow for writing code
creates a consistent code base that makes it easier to maintain in the
long run and it also helps people new to programming, or people not so
new to programming, in the developer learning curve, e.g.:

-   <https://medium.com/@arnabdhar430/why-you-should-keep-learning-as-a-software-engineer-ae69aab8c774>

Major programming languages have official style guides. For example in
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)):

-   <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>

But corporations will often make their own tweaks to the style guide (or
change parts completely) to fit their needs or desires, e.g., Google‚Äôs
Python style guide:

-   <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>

this:

-   <https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/python-vs-r>

R doesn‚Äôt seem to have its own official style guide, e.g.:

-   <https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=r+style+guide&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8>

But there are numerous ‚ÄúR style guides‚Äù. For example, when writing
packages for [The Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org):

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AirSensor/vignettes/Developer_Style_Guide.html>

Google also has an R style guide:

-   <https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html>

If you are using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), they have a
style guide:

-   <https://style.tidyverse.org/>

[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) also has a style guide:

-   <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html>

[R-bloggers]() has a blog about style guides in R, which covers some of
the basic different **between style guide standards**:

To summarize, every programming language, and most groups of
programmers, will have different recommendations for how to do things
like:

-   declare you variables (e.g., should_it_be_with_underscores or
    shouldItBeCamelCase?)
-   are your file names in upper or lower case? (e.g.¬†analysis.R
    vs.¬†Analysis.R?)
-   depending on the language and its naming constratins are your
    variables, methods, etc., using punctiation? (e.g., my.fuction vs
    my_function vs myFunction vs MyFunction‚Ä¶ and so on)
-   where should you introduce (or should you introduce) [new
    lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) into your code,
    editor, etc.?

The
[TL;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read)?
Follow a style guide! It makes your code easier to read. Or as [Hadley
Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham) apparently said:

    Good coding style is like using correct punctuation. You can manage without it, but it sure makes things easier to read. 

Which makes sense. If you want your data practicals to be easily
understood and reproducible, and you want to be come a better and more
consistent programmer (regardless of the programming language), follow a
style guide!

So how do you do that in the easiest way possible? There‚Äôs tools for
that! For example, there‚Äôs an R library called `styler`:

-   <https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/>

That you can use directly in RStudio (or on the command line)! It is
going to tell you why your code is ugly and does not follow the
`tidyverse` style guide. In other words, it‚Äôs a program that looks at
your code and tells you where you aren‚Äôt following the (‚Äúpunctuation‚Äù)
rules!

Use it or some tool like it.

A final note. There are also tools for [debugging your
code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging). This comes in all kinds
of sophistication.

A linter, or to lint, is a code analysis tool that helps you find bugs
in your code:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>

In short, make your coding life easier; use a linter! Here‚Äôs one for R:
