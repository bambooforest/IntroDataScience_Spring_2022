# Overview

[Data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) is a
recent coinage that means to converting [raw
data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_data) (whether analog or
digital) into (an)other format(s) usually with the goal to extract
information through ‚Äúdownstream‚Äù analysis of the data.

Is this raw data?

``` r
text <- "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent vitae nisi nibh. In dolor neque, ultricies a tincidunt et, rutrum in erat. Morbi venenatis massa at neque imperdiet, eu faucibus augue varius. Ut molestie risus in dolor porttitor pretium sit amet vel enim. Pellentesque posuere blandit velit eget ultrices. Sed tristique dui ipsum, id sodales dui egestas id. Proin a dolor placerat, accumsan quam nec, ullamcorper enim. Nunc commodo a quam sit amet molestie. Quisque nec elit et diam consequat aliquet nec sed leo. Mauris scelerisque sed lorem eu bibendum. Morbi id ex commodo, elementum elit at, varius dui. Maecenas facilisis velit ut malesuada lobortis. Vestibulum dictum dapibus velit ut pellentesque."
```

Here‚Äôs a [visualization of the
process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling#/media/File:Data_Wrangling_From_Messy_To_Clean_Data_Management.jpg)
of converting raw data to formatted (or structured) data:

![](Data_Wrangling_From_Messy_To_Clean_Data_Management.jpg)

The steps typically include:

-   **Discovery your data** ‚Äì look at and think about your data and
    maybe come up with some questions to ask
-   **Structure your data** ‚Äì organize the data (necessarily if its in a
    raw format) and structure it for the functions or methods that will
    take it as input
-   **Clean your data** ‚Äì in the process of dealing with data
    (especially raw data), you may need to clean it, e.g., get all the
    dates into the same format (Feb 1 vs 2/1 vs 1/2 etc.)
-   **Enrich your data** ‚Äì do you need more data for your analysis?
    E.g., you have a list of languages but you need to know where they
    are spoken to plot them on a world map
-   **Validate your data** ‚Äì basically making sure that your structured
    and cleaned data is actually structured and clean ‚Äì also commonly
    refered to as [software
    testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing)
-   **Publish your data** ‚Äì and publish your analysis, findings, etc.,
    for consumption, reproducibility, etc.

## In R

Here is a visualization of how the data science workflow works in [R for
Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html):

-   <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html>

That is you:

-   First **import** (load) the data into R ‚Äì this entails that the data
    is already in a loadable format (e.g., CSV file, Excel spreadsheet,
    relational database)
-   Second you ‚Äú**tidy**‚Äù the data (in terms of the
    ‚Äú[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)‚Äù, i.e., a set of R packages
    for data science) ‚Äì more on this below
-   Next you may need to **transform** your data, e.g., select the data
    of interest, extend your data by adding other data source(s),
    summarize results
-   Then you may **visualize** your data, i.e., create plots to explore
    and interact with your data and to develop questions to answer
-   Next you may **model** your data to answer those questions
-   Lastly, you may want to **communicate** your results, e.g., through
    scientific reports like we are developing in class

All of these step fall under the rubric of [computer
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) and to
some extent ‚Äì if we are trying to follow [coding best
practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_best_practices); see
also
[here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mitra/csSummer2014/cs312/lectures/bestPractices.html)
‚Äì [software
engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering).

You will not become software engineers in this class, but you will need
to be able to do some coding. You do not need to be an expert coder, or
programmer, to do data science!

## Loading data

When working with data you first have to have some data. What about this
data for example?

-   <https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc855661/>
-   <https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc855661/m1/2/>

How would you load it into R?

What kind of data type is it?

What kind of data structure?

The ‚Äútidying‚Äù and ‚Äútransforming‚Äù of your data is commonly referred to as
‚Äúdata wrangling‚Äù.

-   <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html>

when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an
observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure
lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data, not fighting
to get the data into the right form for different functions.

# Style

## In general

According to the [dictionary
app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_(software)) on my
computer, style can be defined in various ways, including:

-   ‚Äúa manner of doing something‚Äù
-   ‚Äúa way of using language‚Äù
-   ‚Äúa way of behaving or approaching a situation that is characteristic
    of or favored by a particular person‚Äù
-   ‚Äúelegance and sophistication‚Äù

Most people recognize style when they see it. Whether it is someone‚Äôs
manner or behavior, the way they speak or write, how they dress, how
they create art, etc.

When writing, scientific papers or other things, a [style guide (or
manual of style)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) is often
provided so that different writers (say for example submitting to the
same journal or magazine or news outlet) follow a set of standards for
the writing, formatting, or design of the output being produced. They
typically follow a so-called style-sheet. The idea is that an
established standard makes it easier to create a consistent flow, which
is intended to improve readability, and thus, communication. Consider
for example, if within a scientific paper, every table presented had a
completely different look. Consider the follow example of ugly papers
from [this
website](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/figure-titles-captions.html):

What do you like about it? What don‚Äôt you like about it?

We will talk more about style in data visualizations in future lectures.

## Style in (R) code

Style is also an important factor when writing computer code. All major
software companies have [programming style
guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style). Why? Because a
style guide standard that software engineers follow for writing code
creates a consistent code base that makes it easier to maintain in the
long run and it also helps people new to programming, or people not so
new to programming, in the developer learning curve, e.g.:

-   <https://medium.com/@arnabdhar430/why-you-should-keep-learning-as-a-software-engineer-ae69aab8c774>

Major programming languages have official style guides. For example in
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)):

-   <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>

But corporations will often make their own tweaks to the style guide (or
change parts completely) to fit their needs or desires, e.g., Google‚Äôs
Python style guide:

-   <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>

Want to know more about Python versus R and what to learn and why? Read
this:

-   <https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/python-vs-r>

R doesn‚Äôt seem to have its own official style guide, e.g.:

-   <https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=r+style+guide&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8>

But there are numerous ‚ÄúR style guides‚Äù. For example, when writing
packages for [The Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org):

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AirSensor/vignettes/Developer_Style_Guide.html>

Google also has an R style guide:

-   <https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html>

If you are using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), they have a
style guide:

-   <https://style.tidyverse.org/>

[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) also has a style guide:

-   <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html>

[R-bloggers]() has a blog about style guides in R, which covers some of
the basic different **between style guide standards**:

-   <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/01/üñä-r-coding-style-guide/" class="uri">https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/01/üñä-r-coding-style-guide/</a>

To summarize, every programming language, and most groups of
programmers, will have different recommendations for how to do things
like:

-   declare you variables (e.g., should_it_be_with_underscores or
    shouldItBeCamelCase?)
-   are your file names in upper or lower case? (e.g.¬†analysis.R
    vs.¬†Analysis.R?)
-   depending on the language and its naming constratins are your
    variables, methods, etc., using punctiation? (e.g., my.fuction vs
    my_function vs myFunction vs MyFunction‚Ä¶ and so on)
-   where should you introduce (or should you introduce) [new
    lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) into your code,
    editor, etc.?

The
[TL;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read)?
Follow a style guide! It makes your code easier to read. Or as [Hadley
Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham) apparently said:

    Good coding style is like using correct punctuation. You can manage without it, but it sure makes things easier to read. 

Which makes sense. If you want your data practicals to be easily
understood and reproducible, and you want to be come a better and more
consistent programmer (regardless of the programming language), follow a
style guide!

So how do you do that in the easiest way possible? There‚Äôs tools for
that! For example, there‚Äôs an R library called `styler`:

-   <https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/>
-   <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/styler/vignettes/introducing_styler.html>

That you can use directly in RStudio (or on the command line)! It is
going to tell you why your code is ugly and does not follow the
`tidyverse` style guide. In other words, it‚Äôs a program that looks at
your code and tells you where you aren‚Äôt following the (‚Äúpunctuation‚Äù)
rules!

Use it or some tool like it.

A final note. There are also tools for [debugging your
code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging). This comes in all kinds
of sophistication.

A linter, or to lint, is a code analysis tool that helps you find bugs
in your code:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>

In short, make your coding life easier; use a linter! Here‚Äôs one for R:
