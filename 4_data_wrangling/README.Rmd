# Overview

[Data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) is a recent coinage that means to converting [raw data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_data) (whether analog or digital) into (an)other format(s) usually with the goal to extract information through "downstream" analysis of the data.

Is this raw data?

```{r}
text <- "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent vitae nisi nibh. In dolor neque, ultricies a tincidunt et, rutrum in erat. Morbi venenatis massa at neque imperdiet, eu faucibus augue varius. Ut molestie risus in dolor porttitor pretium sit amet vel enim. Pellentesque posuere blandit velit eget ultrices. Sed tristique dui ipsum, id sodales dui egestas id. Proin a dolor placerat, accumsan quam nec, ullamcorper enim. Nunc commodo a quam sit amet molestie. Quisque nec elit et diam consequat aliquet nec sed leo. Mauris scelerisque sed lorem eu bibendum. Morbi id ex commodo, elementum elit at, varius dui. Maecenas facilisis velit ut malesuada lobortis. Vestibulum dictum dapibus velit ut pellentesque."
```

Here's a [visualization of the process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling#/media/File:Data_Wrangling_From_Messy_To_Clean_Data_Management.jpg) of converting raw data to formatted (or structured) data:

![Visualization of data wrangling](figures/Data_Wrangling_From_Messy_To_Clean_Data_Management.jpg)

The steps typically include:

* **Discovery your data** -- look at and think about your data and maybe come up with some questions to ask
* **Structure your data** -- organize the data (necessarily if its in a raw format) and structure it for the functions or methods that will take it as input
* **Clean your data** -- in the process of dealing with data (especially raw data), you may need to clean it, e.g., get all the dates into the same format (Feb 1 vs 2/1 vs 1/2 etc.)
* **Enrich your data** -- do you need more data for your analysis? E.g., you have a list of languages but you need to know where they are spoken to plot them on a world map
* **Validate your data** -- basically making sure that your structured and cleaned data is actually structured and clean -- also commonly refered to as [software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing)
* **Publish your data** -- and publish your analysis, findings, etc., for consumption, reproducibility, etc.


# In R

Here is a visualization of how the data science workflow works in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html):

* https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html

That is you:

* First **import** (load) the data into R -- this entails that the data is already in a loadable format (e.g., CSV file, Excel spreadsheet, relational database)
* Second you "**tidy**" the data (in terms of the "[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)", i.e., a set of R packages for data science) -- more on this below
* Next you may need to **transform** your data, e.g., select the data of interest, extend your data by adding other data source(s), summarize results
* Then you may **visualize** your data, i.e., create plots to explore and interact with your data and to develop questions to answer
* Next you may **model** your data to answer those questions
* Lastly, you may want to **communicate** your results, e.g., through scientific reports like we are developing in class

All of these step fall under the rubric of [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) and to some extent -- if we are trying to follow [coding best practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_best_practices); see also [here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mitra/csSummer2014/cs312/lectures/bestPractices.html) -- [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering). 

You will not become software engineers in this class, but you will need to be able to do some coding. You do not need to be an expert coder, or programmer, to do data science!


## Loading data

When working with data you first have to have some data. What about this data for example?

* https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc855661/
* https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc855661/m1/2/

How would you load it into R?

What kind of data type is it?

What kind of data structure?

The "tidying" and "transforming" of your data is commonly referred to as "data wrangling".

* https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html

when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions.

# Code style

According to the [dictionary app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_(software)) on my computer, style can be defined in various ways, including:

* "a manner of doing something"
* "a way of using language"
* "a way of behaving or approaching a situation that is characteristic of or favored by a particular person"
* "elegance and sophistication"

Most people recognize style when they see it. Whether it is someone's manner or behavior, the way they speak or write, how they dress, how they create art, etc.

When writing, scientific papers or other things, a [style guide (or manual of style)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) is often provided so that different writers (say for example submitting to the same journal or magazine or news outlet) follow a set of standards for the writing, formatting, or design of the output being produced. They typically follow a so-called style-sheet. The idea is that an established standard makes it easier to create a consistent flow, which is intended to improve readability, and thus, communication. Consider for example, if within a scientific paper, every table presented had a completely different look. Consider the follow example of ugly papers from [this website]( https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/figure-titles-captions.html):

What do you like about it? What don't you like about it?

We will talk more about style in data visualizations in future lectures.


# Code style in R

Style is also an important factor when writing computer code. All major software companies have [programming style guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style). Why? Because a style guide standard that software engineers follow for writing code creates a consistent code base that makes it easier to maintain in the long run and it also helps people new to programming, or people not so new to programming, in the developer learning curve, e.g.:

* https://medium.com/@arnabdhar430/why-you-should-keep-learning-as-a-software-engineer-ae69aab8c774

Major programming languages have official style guides. For example in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)):

* https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

But corporations will often make their own tweaks to the style guide (or change parts completely) to fit their needs or desires, e.g., Google's Python style guide:

* https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

Want to know more about Python versus R and what to learn and why? Read this:

* https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/python-vs-r

R doesn't seem to have its own official style guide, e.g.:

* https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=r+style+guide&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8

But there are numerous "R style guides". For example, when writing packages for [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org):

* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AirSensor/vignettes/Developer_Style_Guide.html

Google also has an R style guide:

* https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html

If you are using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), they have a style guide:

* https://style.tidyverse.org/

[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) also has a style guide:

* http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html

[R-bloggers]() has a blog about style guides in R, which covers some of the basic different **between style guide standards**:

* https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/01/🖊-r-coding-style-guide/

To summarize, every programming language, and most groups of programmers, will have different recommendations for how to do things like:

* declare you variables (e.g., should_it_be_with_underscores or shouldItBeCamelCase?)
* are your file names in upper or lower case? (e.g. analysis.R vs. Analysis.R?)
* depending on the language and its naming constratins are your variables, methods, etc., using punctiation? (e.g., my.fuction vs my_function vs myFunction vs MyFunction... and so on)
* where should you introduce (or should you introduce) [new lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) into your code, editor, etc.? 

The [TL;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read)? Follow a style guide! It makes your code easier to read. Or as [Hadley Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham) apparently said:

```
Good coding style is like using correct punctuation. You can manage without it, but it sure makes things easier to read. 
```

Which makes sense. If you want your data practicals to be easily understood and reproducible, and you want to be come a better and more consistent programmer (regardless of the programming language), follow a style guide!

So how do you do that in the easiest way possible? There's tools for that! For example, there's an R library called `styler`:

* https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/
* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/styler/vignettes/introducing_styler.html

That you can use directly in RStudio (or on the command line)! It is going to tell you why your code is ugly and does not follow the `tidyverse` style guide. In other words, it's a program that looks at your code and tells you where you aren't following the ("punctuation") rules!

Use it or some tool like it.

A final note. There are also tools for [debugging your code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging). This comes in all kinds of sophistication. 

A linter, or to lint, is a code analysis tool that helps you find bugs in your code:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)

In short, make your coding life easier; use a linter! Here's one for R:
