# Overview

[Data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) is the
process (or processes) of cleaning, structuring (aka transforming), and
enriching data into a format that allows one to do things like
visualization and analysis. Typically, [raw
data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_data) is converted into
structured data. During this process, raw data often need to be cleaned,
organized, and transformed into formats that are allow for analysis,
i.e., converted into data formats or data structures that can be fed
directly into functions for coding or statistical analysis.

Here‚Äôs a [visualization of the
process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling#/media/File:Data_Wrangling_From_Messy_To_Clean_Data_Management.jpg)
of converting raw data to formatted (or structured) data:

![Visualization of data
wrangling](figures/Data_Wrangling_From_Messy_To_Clean_Data_Management.jpg)

The steps in data wrangling, broadly, include:

-   **Discovery your data** ‚Äì look at and think about your data and
    maybe come up with some questions to ask
-   **Structure your data** ‚Äì organize the data (necessarily if its in a
    raw format) and structure it for the functions or methods that will
    take it as input
-   **Clean your data** ‚Äì in the process of dealing with data
    (especially raw data), you may need to clean it, e.g., get all the
    dates into the same format (Feb 1 vs 2/1 vs 1/2 etc.)
-   **Enrich your data** ‚Äì do you need more data for your analysis?
    E.g., you have a list of languages but you need to know where they
    are spoken to plot them on a world map
-   **Validate your data** ‚Äì basically making sure that your structured
    and cleaned data is actually structured and clean ‚Äì also commonly
    refereed to as [software
    testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing)
-   **Publish your data** ‚Äì and publish your analysis, findings, etc.,
    for consumption, reproducibility, etc.

# Data wrangling in R

Here is a visualization of how the data science workflow works in the
book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html):

-   <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html>

That is you:

1.  **Load**, aka ‚Äúimport,‚Äù your data into R ‚Äì this entails that the
    data is already in a loadable format (e.g., text, CSV file, Excel
    spreadsheet, relational database)
2.  **Tidy** the data ‚Äì in terms of the R
    [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), i.e., a set of R packages
    aimed to make data science easy (more on this below)
3.  **Transform** your data ‚Äì select the data of interest, extend your
    data by adding other data source(s), summarize results
4.  **Visualize** your data ‚Äì create plots to explore and interact with
    your data and to develop questions to answer
5.  **Model** your data ‚Äì to answer questions and hypotheses
6.  **Communicate** your results ‚Äì through scientific reports like we
    the ones we are developing in class

All of these step fall under the rubric of [computer
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming). You
may not become expert computer programmers, or software engineers, but
in this course will need to be able to do some basic coding in R. Keep
in mind: you do not need to be an expert coder, or programmer, to do
data science!

<!-- and to some extent -- if we are trying to follow [coding best practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_best_practices); see also [here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mitra/csSummer2014/cs312/lectures/bestPractices.html) -- [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering). -->

## Loading data

When working with data you first have to have some data. What about this data for example?

* https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc855661/
* https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc855661/m1/2/

How would you load it into R?

What kind of data type is it?

What kind of data structure?

The "tidying" and "transforming" of your data is commonly referred to as "data wrangling".

* https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html

when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions.
-->

## tidyverse

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is an opinionated collection
of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an
underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.
[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) includes several R
[packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) for data science. We may
not use all of them in this class, but they currently include:

-   [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org): for creating graphics
-   [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org): for data manipulation
-   [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org): to make your data tidy
-   [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org): for reading / loading data
-   [purr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org): enhancements for functional
    programming
-   [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org): update of the R [data
    frame](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/data.frame.html)
-   [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org): functions for working with
    strings
-   [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org): functions for dealing with
    [factors](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/factor.html)
    in R

To load the `tidyverse` package, which then includes all the libraries
above, first install it and then load:

``` r
# install.packages("tidyverse") # run this first if you need to install tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
```

## Loading data

There are numerous ways to load data into R. The `readr` is the
`tidyverse` library that lets us read in plain text data in various
formats:

| Function   | Format                                          | Filename typically ends with |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| read_table | white space separated values                    | txt                          |
| read_csv   | comma separated values                          | csv                          |
| read_csv2  | semicolon separated values                      | csv                          |
| read_tsv   | tab delimited separated values                  | tsv                          |
| read_delim | general text file format, must define delimiter | txt                          |

Below we will load some csv data and have a look at it.

As well as `readr`, the `tidyverse` package will install several
packages for reading in other types of formats, such as Excel with
`[readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org)`, e.g.:

| Function   | Format                 | Filename typically ends with |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| read_excel | auto detect the format | xls, xlsx                    |
| read_xls   | original format        | xls                          |
| read_xlsx  | new format             | xlsx                         |

There are also load functions in ‚Äúbase‚Äù R. It contains similar functions
to `tidyverse` functions, e.g., `read.csv`, `read.table`. They load data
slightly differently and into different data types.

``` r
df <- read_csv('datasets/athletes.csv')
```

One reason that people choose a library like `readr::read_csv` over base
R‚Äôs `read.csv` is because the latter automatically converts strings to
factors. If you use base R‚Äôs `read.csv` and want to keep strings as
factors, you have to additionally set the parameter `stringsAsFactors`
to FALSE, i.e.:

``` r
df <- read.csv('datasets/athletes.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
class(df)
```

    ## [1] "data.frame"

``` r
str(df)
```

## dplyr

Once you‚Äôve loaded a data set into a data frame (or
[tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org)), you can begin to work with it.

`dplyr` was developed by [Hadley
Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham) (the author of
`plyr`, `ggplot2, etc.`). He also co-wrote a great introduction on the
topic, look at [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (Wickham
and Grolemund 2016), specifically the section [dplyr
basics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html?q=dplyr#dplyr-basics).

`dplyr` is super-fast on data frames. Essentially, one works with five
basic ‚Äúverbs‚Äù or functions:

-   `select()`: for subsetting variables/columns
-   `arrange()`: for re-ordering rows
-   `mutate()`: for adding new columns
-   `filter()`: for subsetting rows
-   `summarize()` (or `summarise()` if you prefer [British
    spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences)):
    for reducing each group to a smaller number of summary statistics

Let‚Äôs try them out!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs use the data set `athletes.csv` for an example of working with
some of `tidyverse` tools.

The data set `athletes.csv` contains various details about the athletes
who participated in the [2014 Winter Olympics in
Sochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics). Here we use
the version of this data set converted by [Dana
Silver](https://www.danasilver.org/sochi/). The data was originally
retrieved in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) from
Kimono Lab‚Äôs Sochi API on February 18, 2014.

When we load tabular (or table) data, we will usually be using the R
data frame. A data frame is a table in which columns contain values of
one data type and each row contains a set of values of that data type.
The data frame is the most common way of storing data in R. ([Under the
hood](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/under_the_hood), data frames are a
list of equal length vectors ‚Äì each element of the list can be thought
of as a column and the length of each element of the list is its number
of rows.) Data frames have the following characteristics:

-   Column names should not be empty
-   Row names should be unique
-   Data stored in the data frame can be of type numeric, factor, of
    character
-   Each column should contain the same number of items

If you are working within this repository on your local computer, you
can load the data in this directory with this command:

``` r
athletes <- read_csv("datasets/athletes.csv")
```

You can also give it the full path, depending on where the data is on
your local computer.

Perhaps easiest, however, is to load it from the repository on the web
directly. The `readr` package makes this easy by allowing you to wrap
the `url` function into the `read_csv` function:

``` r
athletes <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/main/4_data_wrangling/datasets/athletes.csv"))
```

Note that GitHub displays well-formatted CSV files as tabular data:

-   <https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/blob/main/4_data_wrangling/datasets/athletes.csv>

But if you want to load it from the web, you need to use the raw data
(note the button on the GitHub page with the label ‚Äúraw,‚Äù which results
in this URL:

-   <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/main/4_data_wrangling/datasets/athletes.csv>

Now that you‚Äôve loaded the `atheletes.csv` data, let‚Äôs have a look at
its structure with the `str()` function:

``` r
str(athletes)
```

    ## spec_tbl_df [2,859 √ó 12] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ age          : num [1:2859] 17 27 21 21 21 21 18 23 17 21 ...

    ##  $ sport        : chr [1:2859] "Freestyle Skiing" "Snowboard" "Short Track" "Figure Skating" ...
    ##  $ country      : chr [1:2859] "United States" "Italy" "Kazakhstan" "Kazakhstan" ...
    ##  - attr(*, "spec")=
    ##   .. cols(
    ##   ..   age = col_double(),
    ##   ..   birthdate = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   ..   gender = col_character(),
    ##   ..   height = col_double(),
    ##   ..   name = col_character(),
    ##   ..   weight = col_double(),
    ##   ..   gold_medals = col_double(),
    ##   ..   silver_medals = col_double(),
    ##   ..   bronze_medals = col_double(),
    ##   ..   total_medals = col_double(),
    ##   ..   sport = col_character(),
    ##   ..   country = col_character()
    ##   .. )

Recall our discussion about [data types for computer
programming](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/3_data#data-types-for-computer-programming)
and [data types for
statistics](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/3_data#data-types-in-statistics).

**What kind of variables do we have in our data set?**

Some variables should be converted from
[character](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/character.html)
to
[factor](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/factor.html).
You probably will want to use `gender`, and `sport`. Convert these two
variables one by one:

``` r
athletes$gender <- as.factor(athletes$gender)
athletes$sport <- as.factor(athletes$sport)
```

Now note the change in data type:

``` r
str(athletes)
```

Also, recall our discussion about [tabular
data](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/3_data#tabular-data).

What are the variables in `athletes`?

What are the objects of observation?

If any row is lacking information for a particular column, a missing
value called `NA` will be inserted in that cell.

One useful function is `summary()`, which will summarize the contents of
the data frame.

``` r
summary(athletes)
```

Now some functions that we can select, filter, transform, extract, and
summarize aspects of the data.

### `select()`

The data set contains the details on age, birth date, gender, height,
name, weight, medal counts, sport, and country and a few more variables.
Not all of these variables are of interest for a specific research
question and often one wants to have a ‚Äúnarrower‚Äù version of a data set
which contains only the variables of immediate interest.

To prepare such a version of your data set, use the function `select()`
to select the variables (columns) you need.

-   First, you can select the variables of interest just by naming them.
    Note that this way you can also modify the order of the variables:

``` r
select(athletes, name, height, weight)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2,859 x 3
    ##    name              height weight
    ##    <chr>              <dbl>  <dbl>
    ##  1 Aaron Blunck        1.72     68
    ##  2 Aaron March         1.85     85
    ##  3 Abzal Azhgaliyev    1.78     68
    ##  4 Abzal Rakimgaliev   1.68     NA
    ##  5 Adam Barwood        1.86     82
    ##  6 Adam Cieslar        1.75     57
    ##  7 Adam Lamhamedi      1.7      76
    ##  8 Adam Zampa          1.78     80
    ##  9 Adelina Sotnikova   1.63     NA
    ## 10 Adeline Baud        1.62     56
    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 2,849 more rows

-   You can use `:` to select all columns in a range between two
    specified columns (inclusively):

``` r
select(athletes, age:weight)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2,859 x 6
    ##      age birthdate  gender height name              weight
    ##    <dbl> <date>     <fct>   <dbl> <chr>              <dbl>
    ##  1    17 1996-04-12 Male     1.72 Aaron Blunck          68
    ##  2    27 1986-05-14 Male     1.85 Aaron March           85
    ##  3    21 1992-06-30 Male     1.78 Abzal Azhgaliyev      68
    ##  4    21 1992-05-25 Male     1.68 Abzal Rakimgaliev     NA
    ##  5    21 1992-07-30 Male     1.86 Adam Barwood          82
    ##  6    21 1992-12-18 Male     1.75 Adam Cieslar          57
    ##  7    18 1995-04-22 Male     1.7  Adam Lamhamedi        76
    ##  8    23 1990-09-13 Male     1.78 Adam Zampa            80
    ##  9    17 1996-07-01 Female   1.63 Adelina Sotnikova     NA
    ## 10    21 1992-09-28 Female   1.62 Adeline Baud          56
    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 2,849 more rows

-   You can exclude a variable with the help of `-`.

``` r
select(athletes, -birthdate, -age)
```

    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 2,849 more rows, and 3 more variables: total_medals <dbl>,
    ## #   sport <fct>, country <chr>

Note that `dplyr` functions never modify their input data frames. If you
want to save the result e.g., of the `select()`function, you need to use
the assignment operator `<-` and either overwrite the original data
frame or create a new one.

For instance, here the original data frame remains unchanged:

``` r
select(athletes, birthdate, age)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2,859 x 2
    ##    birthdate    age
    ##    <date>     <dbl>

    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 2,849 more rows, and 4 more variables: bronze_medals <dbl>,
    ## #   total_medals <dbl>, sport <fct>, country <chr>

And here we create a new data frame with the selected columns only:

``` r
athletes_age <- select(athletes, birthdate, age)
athletes_age
```

    ## # A tibble: 2,859 x 2
    ##    birthdate    age
    ##    <date>     <dbl>
    ##  1 1996-04-12    17

    ## 10 1992-09-28    21
    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 2,849 more rows

There are a number of **helper functions** you can use within
`select()`. Try to guess what they do before executing the commands:

1.  **`ends_with()`**

``` r
select(athletes, ends_with("medals"))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2,859 x 4
    ##    gold_medals silver_medals bronze_medals total_medals
    ##          <dbl>         <dbl>         <dbl>        <dbl>
    ##  1           0             0             0            0
    ##  2           0             0             0            0
    ##  3           0             0             0            0
    ##  4           0             0             0            0
    ##  5           0             0             0            0
    ##  6           0             0             0            0
    ##  7           0             0             0            0
    ##  8           0             0             0            0
    ##  9           0             0             0            0
    ## 10           0             0             0            0
    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 2,849 more rows

2.  **`contains()`**

``` r
select(athletes, contains("eigh"))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2,859 x 2
    ##    height weight
    ##     <dbl>  <dbl>
    ##  1   1.72     68
    ##  2   1.85     85
    ##  3   1.78     68
    ##  4   1.68     NA
    ##  5   1.86     82
    ##  6   1.75     57
    ##  7   1.7      76
    ##  8   1.78     80
    ##  9   1.63     NA
    ## 10   1.62     56
    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 2,849 more rows

3.  For details on other helper functions, see `?select`.

``` r
?select
```

### `arrange()`

`arrange()` changes the order of the rows. It takes a data frame and a
set of column names to order by. If you list more than one column name,
each additional column is used to break ties in the values of preceding
columns.

1.  Guess what the following code will do before executing it!

``` r
arrange(athletes, height, age)
```

<!-- The data set is first order in an ascending order by `height`. In case two or more athletes have the same height, `age` is used to break ties (also in ascending order), e.g. several athletes have the height of 1.50 cm, they are then order from youngest to oldest. -->

2.  Guess what the following code will do before executing it!

``` r
arrange(athletes, desc(height), age)
```

<!-- The data set is first order in a descending order by `height`. In case two or more athletes have the same height, `age` is used to break ties (but now in ascending order), e.g. among the tallest athletes are the four athletes with the height of 2.00 cm, they are then order from youngest to oldest. -->

3.  Use only the `arrange()` to display the oldest female athlete at the
    top of the sorted data set. How old is she?

``` r
arrange(athletes, gender, desc(age))
```

<!-- Angelica Morrone is 48 years old. -->

### `mutate()`

Besides working with existing columns, it is sometimes necessary to add
new columns that are functions of existing columns. That‚Äôs what the
`mutate()` function is for.

`mutate()` always adds new columns at the end of your data set so we‚Äôll
start by creating a narrower data set so we can see the new variables.
(Remember that when you use in RStudio, an easy way to see all the
columns is `View()`.)

First, create with `select()` a narrow data set `athletes_narrow` which
only contains the variables `name`, `gender`, `age`, `sport`, `height`,
and `weight`. (Here, we add a few more columns than we need now, because
we plan to use `athletes_narrow` later).

``` r
athletes_narrow <- select(athletes, name, gender, age, sport, height, weight)
athletes_narrow
```

Next, add the column BMI (body mass index). The BMI is calculated as the
body mass (`weight`) divided by the square of the body `height`. It is
universally expressed in units of kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

``` r
mutate(athletes_narrow, BMI = weight/height^2)
```

There are many functions for creating new variables that you can use
with `mutate()`. Think of a function and look up
[here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html?q=dplyr#mutate-funs)
(Wickham and Grolemund 2016) for possible solutions.

### `filter()`

Probably the most useful `dplyr` function is `filter()`. It allows you
to subset observations based on their values. Or in other words, you can
extract some rows from your data set on the basis of certain conditions.
The first argument of this function is the name of the data frame. The
second and subsequent arguments are the expressions that filter the data
frame.

For example, we can select all athletes who are taller than 2.00 m. Here
we continue to work with `athletes_narrow`:

``` r
filter(athletes_narrow, height > 2)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 7
    ##   name               gender   age sport      height weight   BMI
    ##   <chr>              <fct>  <dbl> <fct>       <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Aleksandar Bundalo Male      24 Bobsleigh    2.02    106  26.0
    ## 2 Zdeno Chara        Male      36 Ice Hockey   2.06    117  27.6

To use `filter()` effectively, you have to know how to select the
observations that you want using the comparison operators in R. The
standard comparison operators are `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not
equal), and `==` (equal).

The operator `==` can be used with numeric variables to filter a
specific values, e.g., all athletes who are 15 years old:

``` r
filter(athletes_narrow, age == 15)
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 x 7
    ##   name              gender   age sport            height weight   BMI
    ##   <chr>             <fct>  <dbl> <fct>             <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Alina Muller      Female    15 Ice Hockey         1.62     50  19.1
    ## 2 Anna Seidel       Female    15 Short Track       NA        43  NA  
    ## 3 Ayumu Hirano      Male      15 Snowboard          1.6      50  19.5
    ## 4 Elizaveta Ukolova Female    15 Figure Skating     1.71     NA  NA  
    ## 5 Gianina Ernst     Female    15 Ski Jumping        1.53     44  18.8
    ## 6 Marco Ladner      Male      15 Freestyle Skiing   1.75     65  21.2
    ## 7 Perrine Laffont   Female    15 Freestyle Skiing   1.62     50  19.1
    ## 8 Polina Edmunds    Female    15 Figure Skating     1.65     NA  NA  
    ## 9 Yulia Lipnitskaya Female    15 Figure Skating     1.58     NA  NA

When you‚Äôre starting out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to use =
instead of == when testing for equality. When this happens you‚Äôll get an
informative error. Try it out:

``` r
filter(athletes_narrow, age = 15)
```

Another important function when filtering is to identify and potentially
filter out `NA` cells. These are missing or unknown values in the data
set. R [provides a
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/NA.html)
called `is.na()` that tests whether a value is missing or not. `NA` is a
special value in R.

``` r
x <- NA # special value NA
y <- 1 # integer
z <- 'NA' # character (string)
is.na(x)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
is.na(y)
```

    ## [1] FALSE

``` r
is.na(z)
```

    ## [1] FALSE

Let‚Äôs filter the rows in `athletes` that do not have a height value,
i.e., they are `NA` in the table.

``` r
athletes %>% filter(is.na(height))
```

You can also filter to **remove** `NA`s, which is often useful for when
you want to visualize the data. Use the logical operation `!` mentioned
above, i.e., ‚Äúnot.‚Äù

``` r
athletes %>% filter(!is.na(height))
```

    ## #   total_medals <dbl>, sport <fct>, country <chr>

You can also combined the filters. For example, if you want all rows in
`atheletes` that do not have `NA` values for `height` and `weight`.
Notice how the number of rows decreases.

``` r
athletes %>% filter(!is.na(height)) %>% filter(!is.na(weight))
```

If you want to check if there are any `NA`s in a column, you can also
use the `any()` function.

``` r
any(is.na(athletes$height))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
any(is.na(athletes$age))
```

    ## [1] FALSE

Another useful function is called `table()`. What does it do?

``` r
table(athletes$sport)
```

Note you need to use the `exclude = FALSE` parameter, if you want the
`table()` function to count `NA`s. How many athlete

``` r
table(athletes$height)

**Try these out!**

Use the data frame `athletes_narrow`.

1.  Filter all the athletes who are heavier than 110 kg.

2.  Filter the athletes who weigh exactly 110 or more kg. How many
    athletes are these? To get the answer, use the function `nrow()` for
    **n**umber of **row**s‚Äô in addition to `filter()`
    (i.e.¬†`nrows(filter(...))`). We recommend though looking first at
    the filter output to be sure that it worked the way you intended
    before applying `nrow()`.

3.  Filter all the athletes who weigh between 105 and 110 kg. How many
    are they?

### `summarize()`

The dplyr function `summarize()` (or `summarise()`) summarizes multiple
values in a single value.

Let‚Äôs create a data frame as an [reproducible
example](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html). What is a
reproducible example:

-   <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example>
-   <https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example>
-   <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html>
-   <https://xiangxing98.github.io/R_Learning/R_Reproducible.nb.html>

``` r
df <- data.frame(
    color = c('blue', 'black', 'blue', 'blue', 'black'),
    value = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
)

df
```

    ##   color value
    ## 1  blue     1
    ## 2 black     2
    ## 3  blue     3
    ## 4  blue     4
    ## 5 black     5

So, let‚Äôs sum up the value column with `summarize()`.

``` r
summarize(df, total = sum(value))
```

    ##   total
    ## 1    15

We can do the same thing with the `athletes` data frame, for example,
for gold medals.

``` r
athletes %>% summarize(totals = sum(gold_medals))
```

An important function of `summarize()` is in coordination with the
`group_by()` function. The dplyr `group_by` function take an existing
data frame and performs an operation by group. For example, let‚Äôs group
our data frame `df` by the color column.

``` r
df %>% group_by(color) %>% summarize(total = sum(value))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 2
    ##   color total
    ##   <chr> <dbl>
    ## 1 black     7
    ## 2 blue      8

You can also save the results to a new data frame.

``` r
by_color <- df %>% group_by(color) %>% summarize(total = sum(value))
by_color
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 2
    ##   color total
    ##   <chr> <dbl>
    ## 1 black     7
    ## 2 blue      8

We can also use `group_by` on the athletes data. For example, how many
gold medals per country?

``` r
athletes %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(gold_medals = sum(gold_medals))
```

    ## # A tibble: 88 x 2
    ##    country    gold_medals
    ##    <chr>            <dbl>
    ##  1 Albania              0
    ##  2 Andorra              0
    ##  3 Argentina            0
    ##  4 Armenia              0
    ##  5 Australia            0
    ##  6 Austria              2
    ##  7 Azerbaijan           0
    ##  8 Belarus              5
    ##  9 Belgium              0
    ## 10 Bermuda              0
    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 78 more rows

Maybe for viewing purposes it‚Äôs better to arrange them by number of gold
medals instead of alphabetically by country name.

``` r
athletes %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(gold_medals = sum(gold_medals)) %>% arrange(desc(gold_medals))
```

    ## # A tibble: 88 x 2
    ##    country       gold_medals
    ##    <chr>               <dbl>
    ##  1 Russian Fed.           16
    ##  2 Germany                15
    ##  3 Sweden                  8
    ##  4 Norway                  7
    ##  5 Korea                   6
    ##  6 Netherlands             6
    ##  7 United States           6
    ##  8 Belarus                 5
    ##  9 Switzerland             5
    ## 10 Canada                  4
    ## # ‚Ä¶ with 78 more rows

As we continue to [pipe](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html) commands
together, i.e., putting multiple operations (aka dplyr verbs) together ‚Äì
we can use [white
space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character) to style the
code. More on style below.

``` r
athletes %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(gold_medals = sum(gold_medals)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(gold_medals))
```

    ## # A tibble: 88 x 2
    ##    country       gold_medals
    ##    <chr>               <dbl>
    ##  1 Russian Fed.           16
    ##  2 Germany                15
    ##  3 Sweden                  8
    ##  4 Norway                  7
    ##  5 Korea                   6
    ##  6 Netherlands             6
    ##  7 United States           6
    ##  8 Belarus                 5
    ##  9 Switzerland             5

# Databases

## Overview

The table (or flat file) model is simple to read and easy to manipulate.
It consists of a two-dimensional array of data elements. The placement
of data in rows and columns provides the data with structure, and thus,
meaning.

<!--

* https://glottolog.org/glottolog/language
* https://cdstar.eva.mpg.de/bitstreams/EAEA0-F8BB-0AB6-96FA-0/languages_and_dialects_geo.csv
-->

A table‚Äôs columns and rows specify relationships among the cells in the
table, some of which are implicit. Spreadsheets are a way to
interactively work with the data. Consider this data set:

``` r
head(athletes)
```

Table data can be cut and spliced in various ways. But most data is
specific to some purposes. The real power comes when data sets are
combined in various new ways to ask new questions. Traditionally, such
data models of multiple, yet associated tables, comes from business
(cf.¬†[history of IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM)).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Relational
databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) are
structures for storing data whose purpose is to make entering,
searching, analyzing, and updating data as easy and efficient as
possible.

Fundamentally, a relational database is a set of tables, which
themselves are made up of sets of rows and sets of columns. Relational
databases provide two basic operations:

-   Retrieving a set of columns and
-   Retrieving a set of rows

These two basic operations to retrieve columns and rows can also be
combined. [Set
operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_operations_(SQL)) on
tables can be performed on two or more tables, allowing users to perform
operations like
[intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection), [cartesian
product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product), adding or
subtracting tables from each other, etc.

The real power of relational databases is when operations are made on
sets of tables that are not the same, but that share at least one
column.

[Here](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/sql/Relational_Database_Design.html)
is a tutorial on relational database design. Note the `Teachers` to
`Classes` figure, where the two tables are ‚Äúlinked‚Äù or ‚Äúrelated‚Äù to each
other by the `teacherID` columns.

It is rare that data analysis involves only on table. Often you want to
combine different tables on a shared value, so that you can answer
questions you are interested in.

## Joining tables

When joining two or more tables, you always join two tables first. Then
if you have a third, fourth, etc., table, you join them to the already
joined table.

Let‚Äôs install the
[gapminder](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html)
R library that contains an excerpt of data from
[Gapminder.org](Gapminder.org). Read more about their mission
[here](https://www.gapminder.org/about/).

And as usual, make sure to properly cite your sources! Here‚Äôs an easy
way to get the citation for the `gapminder` library (Bryan 2017) or more
generally any R library with `citation()`.

``` r
citation('gapminder')
```

    ## 
    ## To cite package 'gapminder' in publications use:
    ## 
    ##   Jennifer Bryan (2017). gapminder: Data from Gapminder. R package
    ##   version 0.3.0. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gapminder
    ## 
    ## A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is
    ## 
    ##   @Manual{,
    ##     title = {gapminder: Data from Gapminder},
    ##     author = {Jennifer Bryan},
    ##     year = {2017},
    ##     note = {R package version 0.3.0},
    ##     url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gapminder},
    ##   }

First install the library, and if you already have, load it.

``` r
# install.packages('gapminder') # install the gapminder R library
library(gapminder)
```

Let‚Äôs have a look at the description of the data. This will appear in
RStudio.

``` r
?gapminder
```

How does the data look?

``` r
head(gapminder)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 6
    ##   country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
    ##   <fct>       <fct>     <int>   <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>
    ## 1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.
    ## 2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.
    ## 3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.
    ## 4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.
    ## 5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.
    ## 6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.

How is it structured? How many rows does the table have? How many
columns?

``` r
str(gapminder)
```

    ## tibble [1,704 √ó 6] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
    ##  $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
    ##  $ year     : int [1:1704] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
    ##  $ lifeExp  : num [1:1704] 28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...

    ##  $ gdpPercap: num [1:1704] 779 821 853 836 740 ...

Here‚Äôs some more gapminder data, but this data set is about the [sex
ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_sex_ratio) by
country, i.e., the comparative number of males with respect to each
female in a population.

We‚Äôve accessed the data from this overview on how to [add and combine
data
sets](https://csiro-data-school.github.io/r/10-Data-Verbs---join/index.html).
It has some great visualizations about [relational database
joins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)):

-   <https://tavareshugo.github.io/r-intro-tidyverse-gapminder/08-joins/index.html>
-   <https://csiro-data-school.github.io/r/10-Data-Verbs---join/index.html>

Let‚Äôs load the [sex ratio
data](https://csiro-data-school.github.io/r/data/gapminder_sex_ratios.csv)
from Gapminder. There‚Äôs a copy in this course‚Äôs repository [in the
datasets](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/blob/main/4_data_wrangling/datasets/gapminder_sex_ratios.csv)
directory. Recall from above, you can load it locally or directly with
the `url()` within the `read_csv()` function.

This time when we load the data in R Markdown, we do not add the
`message = FALSE` parameter to the code chunk, i.e.,
`{r = message = FALSE}` (see the Rmd file for examples). This means that
the Column specification is output to this markdown file below. What
does it tell us about the columns?

``` r
sex_ratios <- read_csv('datasets/gapminder_sex_ratios.csv')
```

    ## 
    ## ‚îÄ‚îÄ Column specification ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
    ## cols(
    ##   country = col_character(),
    ##   year = col_double(),
    ##   sex_ratio = col_double()
    ## )

So now we have two data sets from Gapminder.

``` r
str(gapminder)
```

    ## tibble [1,704 √ó 6] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
    ##  $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
    ##  $ year     : int [1:1704] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
    ##  $ lifeExp  : num [1:1704] 28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...
    ##  $ pop      : int [1:1704] 8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 14880372 12881816 13867957 16317921 22227415 ...
    ##  $ gdpPercap: num [1:1704] 779 821 853 836 740 ...

``` r
str(sex_ratios)
```

    ## spec_tbl_df [1,722 √ó 3] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ country  : chr [1:1722] "Burundi" "Comoros" "Djibouti" "Eritrea" ...
    ##  $ year     : num [1:1722] 1952 1952 1952 1952 1952 ...
    ##  $ sex_ratio: num [1:1722] 91.9 98.8 98.6 98.2 98.6 ...
    ##  - attr(*, "spec")=
    ##   .. cols(
    ##   ..   country = col_character(),
    ##   ..   year = col_double(),
    ##   ..   sex_ratio = col_double()
    ##   .. )

Which columns are shared between the two data sets? Notice again the
[data
types](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/3_data#data-types-for-computer-programming).

So how do we combine the tables / data frames? Dplyr has several
functions for **joining** tables. Often [Venn
diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram) are used to show
the logical relationships described by different join functions. The
following image is taken from
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram).

![Set functions.](figures/venn_diagrams.png)

They describe the operations from [set
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory) including:

-   [Intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory))
-   [Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory))
-   [Symmetric
    difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference)
-   [Relative
    complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)#Relative_complement)
-   [Absolute
    complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)#Absolute_complement)

Important for us, will be the following types of joins as they are
implemented in dplyr (for more information see the chapter on
[Relational data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) in [R for
Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), from which the
following image was copied):

![Dplyr joins.](figures/dplyr_joins.png)

Before we return to the gapminder data, let‚Äôs illustrate joins with some
example data. First, let‚Äôs create two small tables (data frames) ‚Äì one
for a record of orders and one for customers that made orders.

``` r
orders <- data.frame(
    OrderID = c(101, 102, 103),
    CustomerID = c(2, 37, 77),
    OrderData = c('01.01.2021', '01.02.2021', '02.02.2021')
)
orders
```

    ##   OrderID CustomerID  OrderData
    ## 1     101          2 01.01.2021
    ## 2     102         37 01.02.2021
    ## 3     103         77 02.02.2021

``` r
customers <- data.frame(
    CustomerID = c(1, 2, 3),
    CustomerName = c('Lee Stan', 'Mary Grand', 'Ana Lake'),
    Country = c('USA', 'Australia', 'UK')
)
customers
```

    ##   CustomerID CustomerName   Country
    ## 1          1     Lee Stan       USA
    ## 2          2   Mary Grand Australia
    ## 3          3     Ana Lake        UK

Now we can use the joins to join the table in various ways. What does
each do?

-   Inner join

``` r
inner_join(orders, customers)
```

    ## Joining, by = "CustomerID"

    ##   OrderID CustomerID  OrderData CustomerName   Country
    ## 1     101          2 01.01.2021   Mary Grand Australia

-   Full join

``` r
full_join(orders, customers)
```

    ## Joining, by = "CustomerID"

    ##   OrderID CustomerID  OrderData CustomerName   Country
    ## 1     101          2 01.01.2021   Mary Grand Australia
    ## 2     102         37 01.02.2021         <NA>      <NA>
    ## 3     103         77 02.02.2021         <NA>      <NA>
    ## 4      NA          1       <NA>     Lee Stan       USA
    ## 5      NA          3       <NA>     Ana Lake        UK

-   Left join

``` r
left_join(orders, customers)
```

    ## Joining, by = "CustomerID"

    ##   OrderID CustomerID  OrderData CustomerName   Country
    ## 1     101          2 01.01.2021   Mary Grand Australia
    ## 2     102         37 01.02.2021         <NA>      <NA>
    ## 3     103         77 02.02.2021         <NA>      <NA>

-   Right join

``` r
right_join(orders, customers)
```

    ## Joining, by = "CustomerID"

    ##   OrderID CustomerID  OrderData CustomerName   Country
    ## 1     101          2 01.01.2021   Mary Grand Australia
    ## 2      NA          1       <NA>     Lee Stan       USA
    ## 3      NA          3       <NA>     Ana Lake        UK

Note that `NA` (not applicable, missing data, etc.) is inserted when the
data does not come from one table or the other.

Note also that the join functions will identify which shared columns
exist and the join on those columns. Often it will be the case that you
would like to join two tables that have different column names. You have
two options:

-   Change the column names to match
-   Tell the join on which columns to match

Let‚Äôs make another example. Different programming languages have
different style for naming variables, column names, etc. These styles go
by various names, such as:
[camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) (e.g., iPhone),
PascalCase, and [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).

We will discuss below more about [code
style](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html), but for example R style
guides like [the one from
Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html) suggests using
`BigCamelCase` (i.e., PascalCase) for naming functions. The [tidyverse
style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) suggests using
snake_case for function names and variables. So, as you can see,
different developers different opinions. What is important for your work
is that you choose a style and try to stick with it.

Let‚Äôs update our customers example to snake_case and then show how to
combine it to the orders table.

``` r
customers <- data.frame(
    customer_id = c(1, 2, 3),
    customer_name = c('Lee Stan', 'Mary Grand', 'Ana Lake'),
    country = c('USA', 'Australia', 'UK')
)
customers
```

    ##   customer_id customer_name   country
    ## 1           1      Lee Stan       USA
    ## 2           2    Mary Grand Australia
    ## 3           3      Ana Lake        UK

If you run this code, you will get an error. Try it. What does it tell
you?

``` r
inner_join(orders, customers)
```

Now let‚Äôs specify a parameter in the join so we can map two columns
together.

``` r
inner_join(orders, customers, by=c('CustomerID'='customer_id'))
```

    ##   OrderID CustomerID  OrderData customer_name   country
    ## 1     101          2 01.01.2021    Mary Grand Australia

It works the same for all the joins.

``` r
left_join(orders, customers, by=c('CustomerID'='customer_id'))
```

    ##   OrderID CustomerID  OrderData customer_name   country
    ## 1     101          2 01.01.2021    Mary Grand Australia
    ## 2     102         37 01.02.2021          <NA>      <NA>
    ## 3     103         77 02.02.2021          <NA>      <NA>

Now, back to the gapminder and sex ratio data. What‚Äôs going on here?

``` r
left_join(gapminder, sex_ratios)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("country", "year")

    ## # A tibble: 1,704 x 7
    ##    country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap sex_ratio
    ##    <chr>       <fct>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>     <dbl>

# Code style üí©

Let‚Äôs talk about (code) style. According to the [dictionary
app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_(software)) on my
computer, style can be defined in various ways, including:

-   ‚Äúa manner of doing something‚Äù
-   ‚Äúa way of using language‚Äù
-   ‚Äúa way of behaving or approaching a situation that is characteristic
    of or favored by a particular person‚Äù
-   ‚Äúelegance and sophistication‚Äù

Most people recognize style when they see it. Whether it is someone‚Äôs
manner or behavior, the way they speak or write, how they dress, how
they create art, etc.

When writing, scientific papers or other things, a [style guide (or
manual of style)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) is often
provided so that different writers (say for example submitting to the
same journal or magazine or news outlet) follow a set of standards for
the writing, formatting, or design of the output being produced. They
typically follow a so-called style-sheet. The idea is that an
established standard makes it easier to create a consistent flow, which
is intended to improve readability, and thus, communication. Consider
for example, if within a scientific paper, every table presented had a
completely different look. Consider the follow example of ugly papers
from [this
website](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/figure-titles-captions.html):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Ugly tables.](figures/ugly_tables_example.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What do you like about it? What don‚Äôt you like about it?

We will talk more about style in data visualizations in future lectures.

## Code style in R

Style is also an important factor when writing computer code. All major
software companies have [programming style
guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style). Why? Because a
style guide standard that software engineers follow for writing code
creates a consistent code base that makes it easier to maintain in the
long run and it also helps people new to programming, or people not so
new to programming, in the developer learning curve, e.g.:

-   <https://medium.com/@arnabdhar430/why-you-should-keep-learning-as-a-software-engineer-ae69aab8c774>

Major programming languages have official style guides. For example in
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)):

-   <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>

But corporations will often make their own tweaks to the style guide (or
change parts completely) to fit their needs or desires, e.g., Google‚Äôs
Python style guide:

-   <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>

Want to know more about Python versus R and what to learn and why? Read
this:

-   <https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/python-vs-r>

R doesn‚Äôt seem to have its own official style guide, e.g.:

-   <https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=r+style+guide&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8>

But there are numerous ‚ÄúR style guides.‚Äù For example, when writing
packages for [The Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org):

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AirSensor/vignettes/Developer_Style_Guide.html>

Google also has an R style guide:

-   <https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html>

If you are using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), they have a
style guide:

-   <https://style.tidyverse.org/>

[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) also has a style guide:

-   <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html>

[R-bloggers]() has a blog about style guides in R, which covers some of
the basic different **between style guide standards**:

-   <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/01/üñä-r-coding-style-guide/" class="uri">https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/01/üñä-r-coding-style-guide/</a>

To summarize, every programming language, and most groups of
programmers, will have different recommendations for how to do things
like:

-   declare you variables (e.g., should_it_be_with_underscores or
    shouldItBeCamelCase?)
-   are your file names in upper or lower case? (e.g.¬†analysis.R
    vs.¬†Analysis.R?)
-   depending on the language and its naming constraints are your
    variables, methods, etc., using punctuation? (e.g., my.fiction vs
    my_function vs myFunction vs MyFunction‚Ä¶ and so on)
-   where should you introduce (or should you introduce) [new
    lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) into your code,
    editor, etc.?

The
[TL;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read)?
Follow a style guide! It makes your code easier to read. Or as [Hadley
Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham) apparently said:

> > > Good coding style is like using correct punctuation. You can
> > > manage without it, but it sure makes things easier to read.

Which makes sense. If you want your data practicals to be easily
understood and reproducible, and you want to be come a better and more
consistent programmer (regardless of the programming language), follow a
style guide!

## stylr and lintr

So how do you do that in the easiest way possible? There‚Äôs tools for
that! For example, there‚Äôs an R library called `styler`:

-   <https://style.tidyverse.org>
-   <https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/>
-   <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/styler/vignettes/introducing_styler.html>

That you can use directly in RStudio (or on the command line)! It is
going to tell you why your code is ugly and does not follow the
`tidyverse` style guide. In other words, it‚Äôs a program that looks at
your code and tells you where you aren‚Äôt following the (‚Äúpunctuation‚Äù)
rules!

Use it or some tool like it.

A final note. There are also tools for [debugging your
code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging). This comes in all kinds
of sophistication.

A linter, or to lint, is a code analysis tool that helps you find bugs
in your code:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>

In short, make your coding life easier; use a linter! Here‚Äôs one for R:

-   <https://style.tidyverse.org>
-   <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lintr/readme/README.html>

## Tests

[Software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing)
involves evaluating and verifying whether aspects of software validate
and perform as expected. The idea is to verify that the code (or system)
is working as expected, i.e., that the behavior of the software is
performing as expected.

[Test driven
development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is a
framework for creating [test
cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case) that verify compliance
of specific code requirements.

In R, information about testing can be found here, e.g.:

-   <https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html>
-   <https://testthat.r-lib.org>
-   <https://towardsdatascience.com/unit-testing-in-r-68ab9cc8d211>

# Data practical

For this week‚Äôs data practical, we will load some data and wrangle it a
bit. I encourage you to do the following tasks on a data set of your
choice ‚Äì ideally something you can use for your own research or
something that interests you! There are lots of data sets out there,
e.g.:

-   <https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dslabs/versions/0.7.4>
-   <https://pudding.cool>

The learning objectives are to implement the following tasks on data
sets, e.g., show that you can select, filter, and arrange data in
various ways to turn it into more useful information for analysis.

If you prefer, you can use the suggested data sets below. Please
complete the tasks within an R Markdown report and push the report to
your GitHub repository:

-   Load a data set of your choosing ‚Äì or use the `gapminder` data set
    from the dslabs R library as discussed in this report
-   Filter the data by two variables ‚Äì e.g., countries of your choice ‚Äì
    and save the results to a new data frame
-   Now select a subset of the columns (e.g., country, year, fertility)
    and save them to the data frame
-   Display the first few rows of the data frame
-   Display the law few rows of the data frame
-   Display the structure of the data frame
-   Display the data ordered (arranged) by columns, e.g., the country,
    highest-to-lowest fertility, then year
-   Describe any patterns or lack of patterns that you see in the data
    (note: you can also rearrange the data in other ways if that helps,
    but look at it and write up in a sentence or two your findings)
-   Summarize you results ‚Äì e.g., select the country and fertility rate
    and group by country and summarize the fertility rate ‚Äì and save the
    results to a new data frame
-   Display the results arranged by a column of interest, e.g.,
    lowest-to-highest fertility rates ‚Äì write something about what you
    observe
-   Filter out the `NA`s in your data set and report how many rows are
    affected (i.e., removed)
-   Load two data sets and join them, e.g., the dslabs library has two
    data sets:
    -   [results_us_election_2016](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dslabs/versions/0.7.4/topics/polls_us_election_2016)
    -   [murders](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dslabs/versions/0.7.4/topics/murders)
-   Describe in words how you could explore the relationship between two
    variables in your combined data sets and what it can potentially
    tell us
