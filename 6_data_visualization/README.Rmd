# Visualizing data

## Recap

Recall the discussions on [visualizing data](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/5_data_visualization#visualizing-data) and the [layered graphics principles](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/5_data_visualization#layered-graphics) of [data visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization).

The basic idea is that you can build data visualizations from data and mappings between the data's variables and aesthetic attributes by plotting them on a [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system).

Here is a cheat sheet describing the process:

* https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf

***

In this course we are using the tidyverse visualization library `ggplot2` [@Wickham2016]. 

The book on using the `ggplot2` library is [*ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis*](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html).

A simple plot with `ggplot()` needs minimally:

* Data to visualize -- a data frame or tibble!
* Aesthetics -- mappings from aesthetic attributes (e.g., color, shape, size) to geometric objects (e.g., points, lines, bars)
* Geometries -- e.g., dots, lines, boxes

These essential ingredients (bordered in red) for creating a plot with `ggplot()` are illustrated below in a visualization within the layered grammar of graphics [@Wickham2009].

![Essentials.](../5_data_visualization/figures/essential_ingredients.png)

But let's go through each in detail -- but from bottom up.

## Data

A plot is the information you wish to visualized from some source of data. Recall our discussion about the difference between [data and information](https://github.com/bambooforest/IntroDataScience/tree/main/3_data#what-is-data).

Let's use the integrated `diamonds` data set in R. What does a data scientist do? First have a look at the data!

```{r}
?diamonds
str(diamonds)
head(diamonds) %>% kable()
```

Now one way forward is to ask:

* Which kinds of visualizations can we produce?
* Which kind of research questions can be answered on the basis of this data set?


## Geometries

Geometries -- or "geoms" for short -- are fundamental to building visualizations with `ggplot2`. Geoms determine the type of the plot and are labeled like There are [several basic plot types](https://ggplot2-book.org/individual-geoms.html), e.g., but definitely not limited to:

* geom_point() -- produces a scatterplot
* geom_line() -- makes a line plot
* geom_bar(stat = "identity") -- makes a bar chart

<!--
Here is a more comprehensive list:
geom functions	Description
geom_bar	bars with bases on the x axis
geom_boxplot	a box-and-whiskers plot
geom_density	a smooth density estimate calculated by stat_density
geom_histogram	a histogram
geom_line	connects observations ordered by the x value
geom_point	represents observations as points, as in a scatterplot
geom_jitter	points jittered (usually to reduce overplotting)
geom_smooth	adds a smoothed conditional mean
geom_text	adds textual annotations
geom_tile	a tile plane with rectangles
-->

Let's have a look. What are we plotting?

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
```

Now, each geom function has mandatory and optional aesthetics. This reference table is taken from @Teutonico2015:

![Geoms and their aesthetics.](figures/geoms.png)

It is important to note that function names may change in programming languages -- so always reference the latest version of the programming language or library that you are using!

The `geom_point()` function requires the `x` and `y` aesthetic, but can additionally take the optional aethestics: `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `shape`, and `size`. You can use these aesthetics to visualize your data in other ways.

Color? What does it do?

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=clarity)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Each point is colored according to values in the variable `clarity`. Change the variable, change the color's attribute.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=color)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Some aesthetics can be combined. What's happening here?

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=clarity, size=cut)) + 
  geom_point()
```
What's happening here?

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=clarity, shape=cut)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Geoms can be stacked on top of each other -- one reason they are so powerful. What if you want to visualize a general trend in the data? How about the default [smoothed conditional means](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html) of the response values of the explanatory variables (aka predictors) (see also [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)?

What trend do we see?

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```
Geoms in `ggplot2` have sensible defaults. Above the gray area encompassing the curve is the [confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval), which visualized how much uncertainty is in smoothed curve.

Again, we can begin to explore the data from various angles by using combinations of geoms and their aesthetics. For example, so that we can compare multiple trends within the same data set.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=clarity)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
```
Sometimes the combinations of geoms and their aesthetics can make the picture more or less clear. Data visualization is about achieving clarity (and style) in how you communicate information gleaned from data. Sometimes less is more.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=clarity)) + 
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
```

An important way of making your visualizations clear to your audience is to annotate (aka label) them!

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Number of carets vsrsus their price") +
  xlab("Weight of the dimaon (carats)") +
  ylab("Price in US dollars")
```

And as we've noted before, there are often many different ways to write code that it creates the same output. Keep this in mind when reading other people's code!


## Facets

A powerful tool for exploratory data analysis is [faceting](https://ggplot2-book.org/facet.html) with `ggplot`. Additionally, **faceting** can be used to generate different subplots of a plot by some number of one or more discrete variables.

What happens here?

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~ clarity)
```

And here? Note the tilde `~` basically means "explained by".

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(color ~ clarity)
```


## Statistics

A visualization may also contain **statistical information**, e.g., a regression line, from the data, which is drawn on a specific coordinate system.

We saw an example above that illustrates how to layer multiple geoms together.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```


## Coordinates

[Coordinate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system) in `ggplot2` [have two purposes](https://ggplot2-book.org/coord.html) [@Wickham2016]:

* "Combine the two position aesthetics to produce a 2d position on the plot."
* "In coordination with the faceter, coordinate systems draw axes and panel backgrounds."

Coordinate systems in `ggplot2` come in two types:

* Linear -- they preserve the shape of geoms
* Non-linear -- they can change their shapes

These are advanced techniques and when you think you need them, you should probably study them in detail. There's a free online book for that [@Wickham2016]:

* https://ggplot2-book.org/
* https://ggplot2-book.org/coord.html

But note they also include functions for things like [map projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection). Note also that in R, like most (or all) programming languages, there's lots of libraries to do the same things. 

Remember to search for it and you'll find lots of results (as of writing 79 million plus hits):

* https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=how+to+make+geographic+maps+in+R&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8

Here's a simple example that plots the languages of the world on a simple map.

Let's get the data from the [Glottolog]

```{r, message=FALSE}
df <- read_csv(url('https://cdstar.eva.mpg.de/bitstreams/EAEA0-F8BB-0AB6-96FA-0/languages_and_dialects_geo.csv'))
```

Let's have a look. What are the variables?

```{r}
head(df)
```

What kind of levels are there?

```{r}
table(df$level)
```


Let's filter out just [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language) and drop [dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect).

```{r}
df <- df %>% filter(level == "language")
```

And here is some simple code to plot languages as dots on a world map in mercator projection.

```{r}
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=longitude,y=latitude)) + 
  borders("world", colour="gray50", fill="gray50") + 
  geom_point()
```
Want to add some color? You need a variable for that.

```{r}
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=longitude,y=latitude, color=macroarea)) + 
  borders("world", colour="gray50", fill="gray50") + 
  geom_point()
```



## Theme

[Themes](https://ggplot2-book.org/polishing.html) are a way to finely tune your plots. They give you control of things like the background, fonts, text orientation.

Default theme in `ggplot2` looks like this. Learn how to read a [box plot](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-boxplots-5e2df7bcbd51)?

```{r}
atheletes <- read_csv('../4_data_wrangling/datasets/athletes.csv')
ggplot(data=atheletes, aes(x = gender, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

But you can change the theme with `theme_x`

```{r}
ggplot(data=atheletes, aes(x = gender, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=atheletes, aes(x = gender, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_dark()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=atheletes, aes(x = gender, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic()
```

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(data=atheletes, aes(x = gender, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_tufte(ticks = FALSE)
```

But as we've said now multiple times, there's always different ways of producing the same things when coding. And there's usually libraries to help with that! For example, check out the [ggthemes](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) library.

***

How about changing colors? Here is a [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) with default colors in `ggplot2`.

```{r}
ggplot(atheletes, aes(x=weight, fill=gender)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
ggplot(atheletes, aes(x=weight)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(fill=gender), position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800"))
```

And maybe instead of a histogram you want a [density plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/density.html) to check the distribution of some variable(s)?

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=price, fill=cut)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=price)) + geom_density()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=price, color=cut)) + geom_density()
```


# Visualizations

## Which plot(s) to use?

It depends on your data and the data types in your data. Here is a great visualization and great site that gives you a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) so that you can decide what kind of visualization best fits your data and which caveats you should avoid when creating those visualizations:

* https://www.data-to-viz.com

First you need to know your data type, e.g., are you working with numeric or categorical data? Then ask how many variables you are working with, e.g., one or two or more categorical variables. If you have one categorical variable, for example, your data set is very simple and you can use a bar plot. If you have two or more categorical values, are they independent, nested, etc.? If you have a numerical and categorical variable, in what relation do they stand to each other? Is there order?

Note also the caveats!

* https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html

Remember, you want your visualizations to tell a story. And there are a lot of visualization graphics out there!

* https://www.data-to-viz.com/#story


## Putting it all together: an example

This data visualization below incorporates various libraries to produce a professional looking image. The plot comes from code from this [Introduction to Data Science Repository](https://github.com/datasciencelabs) in this awesome [class](https://datasciencelabs.github.io/pages/syllabus.html) from this [lecture](https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2021/blob/master/04_data_visualization/02_gapminder.Rmd). Lots of good materials in that course -- check it out! 

The R libraries that we will use [@R].

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)
```

Load the `murders` data from from the `dslabs` library [@IrizarryGill2021]. The data set includes reports the number of US gun murders by state for 2010 as reported by the [FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation). It also contains population counts for each state (2010).

```{r}
data(murders)
head(murders)
str(murders)
```

The data set contains variables for:

* Character vector for US states
* Character vector for abbreviations of each US state
* The region in which the state (four categorical values including: Northeast, South, North Central, and West)
* Numerical values for the US state's population
* Numerical values for the total number of gun murders in each state

The data manipulation. Here we calculate the [r correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_coefficient). 

```{r}
r <- murders %>% 
  summarize(pop = sum(population), tot = sum(total)) %>% 
  mutate(murder_rate = tot/pop*10^6) %>% .$murder_rate
```

And now the visualization.

```{r}
murders %>% ggplot(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb)) +  
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty=2, col="darkgrey") +
  geom_point(aes(color=region), size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Populations in millions (log scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Region") +
  theme_economist()
```

We plot the relationship between total number of murders (in [logorathmic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale)) versus the population in [US states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state) (log scale) and color code each state for region. There is a trend that more populous states tend to have more murders.


# Data practical

* Load some data (sets) and describe your data and its variables
* Formulate two questions about the data that you want to visualize
* [Decide how to visualize your variables](https://www.data-to-viz.com)
* Convert your data types if needed, e.g., [to factors](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/12-supp-factors/index.html)
* Create your plots and explain in prose what the data visualizes (see example above)
