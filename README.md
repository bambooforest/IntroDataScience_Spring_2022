## Getting started

### GitHub

Create a [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) account:

* https://github.com

Add your university email and your GitHub path / username to the [repositories tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1di-H7lsmdkT1RJlsXERkIcBSE4Y6XKIwPdulyaZ13DM/edit?usp=sharing). For example, see how I added mine.

Start to understand what [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) is and how GitHub in particular works:

* https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQLK8Ib_SKk
* https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/github-and-rstudio/
* https://happygitwithr.com/index.html

In your GitHub account, e.g. mine is [https://github.com/bambooforest](https://github.com/bambooforest), create a repository for your data practicals. Since one of the [two hardest things in Computer Science (and Data Science)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html) is "naming things", you may either spend some time coming up with a repository name that you like (and ideally that makes sense) or you can simply call it IntroDataScience. You can always change it later! (Caveat: but then you must update the URL in the [repositories tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1di-H7lsmdkT1RJlsXERkIcBSE4Y6XKIwPdulyaZ13DM/edit?usp=sharing) and to tell anyone else you may have shared the URL with -- another reason why naming things is hard: changing names, whether variables in code, URLs, physical addresses, etc., **causes more work**!).

In your data practicals repository for this course, start by creating a [README markdown file](README.md) file -- like the one that you're currently reading -- but instead add some text about what your repository is for.

Why is a "README" file important? [LMGTFY](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/lmgtfy/):

* [https://www.google.com/search?&q=what+is+a+read+me+file](https://www.google.com/search?&q=what+is+a+read+me+file)

Pro-tip: when you initially create a [GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo), if you check the appropriate settings, an empty `README.md` file is created for you. Go ahead and [edit](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files) it.


### RStudio

Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), unless you are already an R Pro and prefer some other [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), or [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that allows you to [create R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html) reports that will be stored in your GitHub repository.


### R

This course assumes you are familiar with the basics of the [R programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language). If you are not, please familiarize yourself with the basics. There are many out there!
