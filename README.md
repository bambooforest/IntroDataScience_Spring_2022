* **Location**: R.103 - [Abram-Louis-Breguet 2](https://goo.gl/maps/ADbAkHFfrKu1VBFU9)
* **ECTS credits**: 3
* **Instructor**: Dr. Steven Moran \<steven.moran@unine.ch\>
* **Office**: Rue Emile-Argand 11, G B35
* **Office hours**: by appointment via email

**Course summary**: The basic principles and methods of [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) will be presented. A central theme is the assessment of scientific claims, and subsequent data collection, transformation, quantitative analysis, and reporting of scientific results. Official course description:

**Form of assessment**: Continuous assessment with data science exercises (graded). Work not submitted by the required deadline will result in a fail for that given assessment.

**Form of education**: Readings, lectures, methods and data practicals.

**Course structure**: The readings will include chapters from: Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World, by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West: 

* https://www.callingbullshit.org

The book is in Moodle. Please practice [critical reading](https://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/critical_reading.pdf). We will begin each class with a presentation by student(s) and then a disucssion of the reading. The presentation should be a short summary of the chapter (~10-15 minutes), in your own thoughts, in powerpoint or similar program. Everyone else should brng their opinions, criticisms, and questions about the reading.

Lectures will be given in class and they will be followed by practical in class work.

Homework will include courses from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com). They are due before the next lecture. For example, Lecture 2 (March 2) “Writing scientific reports”; homework is the interactive course “Reporting with R Markdown”. It is due before Lecture 3 on March 9.

Data practicals will include the creation of R markdown reports for each lecture. You will implement the methods learned in R code and R markdown on dataset(s) of your own interest to produce scientific reports. The reports will then be “committed” and “pushed” to your GitHub repository. We will discuss this procedure in class. The course is heavily weighted on these reports. The idea is that you not only learn how to implement the materials taught in this course, but that after the course is over, you will have a type of portfolio showcasing your data science skills (e.g., something that you can share on a resume or CV or on job or school applications). This approach will be discussed more in class.

**Grading**: 

* 70% data reports in your GitHub repository. There are 12 pertinent lectures and practicals. You must submit 10 data practicals. 70% of your course grade will come from the average of these 10 practicals — or from the 10 best scoring practicals 

* 30% of your grade will come from (a) presentation(s) of the reading chapters (to be divided amongst the students). 

* Homework in DataCamp is pass / fail. That is, you must complete all homework to pass the class. You will be added to our DataCamp and you should receive an invite. DataCamp requires a login.

**Note**: This syllabus is subject to change but the most up-to-date version is always available online:

Then follow the chapters as per the class as per the [class schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1di-H7lsmdkT1RJlsXERkIcBSE4Y6XKIwPdulyaZ13DM/edit?usp=sharing).

Good luck!!
