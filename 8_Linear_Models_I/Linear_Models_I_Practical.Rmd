# Lecture 8 - Linear Models I

For this week's data practical, please note that you should already have set up your GitHub account (from [week 1](../1_introduction/README.md)), which will have an initial README.md file in your repository's [root directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory). The example in this course's repository is the syllabus file, which is named [README.md](../README.md).

Now create your first Linear Model report. You should create the .Rmd file and edit it in RStudio and then knit the output file into an .md file. You have to download a dataset that you are interested in and you have to fit your data in a Linear Model using the methods that we discussed in class.

Here a guideline for your report:

* Find a dataset that you are interested in
* Upload the .csv and check you data
* Which is it your Explanatory and Response variable?
* There is a correlation between the two?
* This correlation implies causation?
* Now fit your model in a (General) Linear Model (remember the assumptions)
* Which model describes better your data? Explain
 
Remember to apply the general suggestion to your report:

* add an appropriate header (e.g., title, author, date, output format)
* add some headers and sub-headers
* Add labels to the axes' plot and add a title for each plot!

Have fun and try to make the report interesting for the reader!
