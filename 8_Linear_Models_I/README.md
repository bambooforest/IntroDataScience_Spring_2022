# Lecture 8 - Linear Models I

For this week’s data practical, please note that you should already have
set up your GitHub account (from [week 1](../1_introduction/README.md)),
which will have an initial README.md file in your repository’s [root
directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory). The example in
this course’s repository is the syllabus file, which is named
[README.md](../README.md).

Now create your first Linear Model report. You should create the .Rmd
file and edit it in RStudio and then knit the output file into an .md
file. You have to download a dataset that you are interested in and you
have to fit your data in a Linear Model using the methods that we
discussed in class.

Here a guideline for your report:

-   Find a dataset that you are interested in
-   Upload the .csv and check you data
-   Which is it your Explanatory and Response variable?
-   There is a correlation between the two?
-   This correlation implies causation?
-   Now fit your model in a (General) Linear Model (remember the
    assumptions)
-   Which model describes better your data? Explain

Remember to apply the general suggestion to your report:

-   add an appropriate header (e.g., title, author, date, output format)
-   add some headers and sub-headers
-   Add labels to the axes’ plot and add a title for each plot!

Have fun and try to make the report interesting for the reader!
