Here's an example that I was interested in regarding data models and all the topics that came before in this course.

...

- Describe collocations
- Reference data (corpus)
- Size of the ngram
- Frequency
- netspeak.org
- Mean and variance
- Plotting variance
- Hypothesis testing
- T test
- Chi square
- Likelihood ratios
- Mutual information
- ANOVAS

Summary statistics only apply to unimodal distributions, i.e., distributions that have a single central peak. If this basic assumption is not met, the your conclusions may be wrong.
